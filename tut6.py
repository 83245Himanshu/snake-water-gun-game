print("Hello World", end=" , ")
#Note : end resembles that in the end instead of new line add space(or anything else that is in inverted commas)
print("This is my First Program", "in Python")
#Note : adding comma adds a space within a string

#Note : all the escape sequence are same just as java. For example

print("Akshat is \n a good boy \t .")
#Note : \n is for new line and \t is for tab space
